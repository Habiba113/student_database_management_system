# Student Database Management System

This Python application allows users to manage a student database through a command-line interface. It provides functionalities to add, view, search, and delete student records, along with user authentication.

## Features

- **Login System**: Users must authenticate with a username and password stored securely (as of current implementation) to access database operations.
  
- **Database Operations**:
  - **Add Student**: Users can add new students with a unique alphanumeric ID, name, and valid grade (A-F).
  - **View Students**: Displays a list of all students currently in the database.
  - **Search Student**: Allows searching for a student by their unique ID.
  - **Delete Student**: Enables deletion of a student record by ID.
  
- **Data Persistence**: Student records are stored in a JSON file (`student_records.json`), ensuring data persists across program executions.

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Python 3.x installed on your system.
   
2. **Setup**:
   - Clone the repository to your local machine.

3. **Installation**:
   - No additional installations are required beyond Python's standard library.

4. **Usage**:
   - Run `python student_database.py` to start the program.
   - Follow the prompts to log in, and then choose options from the menu to manage student records.
